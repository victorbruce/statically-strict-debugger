## 💻 Running the Application

Building the application:

Run the command `npx tsc` to run the typescript files and output the results into a `dist` folder.

To start the development server:

- Install the **Live Server extension**(by Ritwick Dey) in VsCode
- Right-click anywhere in the html code
- Select _Open with Live Server_ from the menu to start the development server

Or

Double click the `index.html` file to open the code in the browser of your choice.

## 📋 Approach

1. I started off by converting all .js files into .ts
2. Next, i setup my project to run typescript by installing typescript in the project and setting my tsconfig file
3. I then resolved all the the type checking errors.
4. Next, I resolved the bugs within the codebase.
5. Finally, i wrote test to cover the happy paths within the application.
